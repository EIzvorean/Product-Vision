                    <ul>
                        <li>A vision conveys purpose</li>
                        <li>Without a vision the people at the company may struggle to explain why the company exists.</li>
                        <li>Vision goes down the line, giving everyone from the CEO to the people below him something to strive for. </li>
                        <li>Helps create a roadmap for the product your company may be working on</li>
                        <li>Think of your product vision statement as a compass that you can consult whenever your team is faced with conflicting priorities or lack of direction.</li>
                        <li>Communicates to your customers of what they can expect from you</li>
                        <li>Can be as simple as a slogan for the company</li>
                        <li>Helps you understand your customer base and narrow down what you want to do in the future</li>
                        <li>Make it inspirational, it should be something your team is motivated by, not something that hangs over them</li>
                        <li>Good way for managers to convey a message without having to micromanage their team on their purpose</li>
                        <li>Good product vision can attract the right employees to your company or project, having everyone share in the experience</li>
                        <li>Make it long or make it short, just make it memorable</li>
                        <li>Should be linked with corporate goals</li>
                        <li>Your vision serves as the north star for every action taken to enhance the product</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Helps Develop Better Product Roadmap</h2>
                    
                    <p>Creating a product vision that your company can follow gives them a good roadmap for where the company and the products will go. A vision for a company is the company's north star that guides them to the products they will work on in the future. Creating a vision allows your team to take a top-down approach to your product’s development. In other words, you begin with a high-level vision statement, then translate that vision into a strategic guide and action plan—the product roadmap. Then, you can translate that roadmap’s strategic overview into a tactical development plan.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Will help you align teams and stakeholders</h2>

                    <p>A product vision statement can also add value by making it easier for your team to clearly articulate the high-level goal driving your product’s development. This can help align the various groups and departments across your company that will be working on your product. With a shared vision, everyone always has a true north to refer back to, which can help remind them of why they’re doing what they’re doing.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Importance?</h2>

                    <p>Most companies don’t have a vision. Subsequently most products don’t have a vision. Sure they have goals and some even have BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goals), but they don’t have a vision. This might seem surprising considering how much has been written about the importance of having a clear company or product vision. This means a lot of companies are just driving in the dark with nothing to guide them besides trying to make money and sell something to customers. This way may work for a while but does not compare to a company with an actual vision.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What is product vision?</h2>

                    <p>Product vision is something that guides a company, kind of like a slogan but it acts as something employees can strive for. This is also a good way of conveying a message to the customers about what your product might be in the future. It should be a little ambitious in nature but also actionable and realistic, something you can see yourself working towards. This helps everyone see the same goal in the end even if they are working on something different than you are. </p>
